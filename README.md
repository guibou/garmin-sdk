This is nix code in order to start / run / build garmin application using the sdk.

Everything here is a bit rusty. Have a look at `default.nix` for examples of how to build a few samples from the sdk as well as building a skydiving pool draw application.

`nix-shell` also gives you access to a devshell containing the simulator.
